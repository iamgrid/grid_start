# grid.start

grid.start is a custom new tab (and home) page for my browser built with vanilla JS, Webpack and BEM (http://getbem.com). It has a nifty built-in theme editor and manager.

**The live version is hosted at https://iamgrid.co.uk/grid_start/.**

**NPM packages in use:**

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/vanilla-picker

**Target browsers:** Desktop versions of Firefox 74+ and Chrome 80+.
